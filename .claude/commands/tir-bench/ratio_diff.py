"""Ratio-based regression diff for tir-bench.

For each (kernel, config) we measure with multiple impls, compute the
ratio ref/ours where ref = fastest non-ours impl picked in baseline and
held fixed across runs. Higher ref/ours = ours is faster than ref =
better. Diff that ratio between baseline and current: positive ratio Δ
means we got faster vs ref (improvement), negative means slower
(regression).

Rationale: under GPU contention every impl slows by a similar factor,
so absolute-ms diffs are dominated by that noise. The ratio between
ours and a same-run reference is unchanged by uniform slowdown, so a
moving ratio is a real perf signal. Rows where the reference impl
itself drifted > 20% are flagged ⚠ — workload's environment was
unstable, so the ratio Δ is less trustworthy.

The report lists every comparable workload in a single table, sorted by
ratio Δ from most-improved to most-regressed (positive → negative).
Baseline workloads that were attempted this run but produced no comparable
measurement (failed, interfered, or missing an impl) are listed in a separate
"Not comparable in current run" section so lost coverage is never silent.

Usage:
    python ratio_diff.py [baseline.json] [current.json] [-o PATH]

Importable as `build_report(baseline_path, current)` for use from
`run.py`.

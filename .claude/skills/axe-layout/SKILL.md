  Expert knowledge on Axe Layout — the hardware-aware layout abstraction in TIR/TIRX.
  Use this skill when working with TLayout, TileLayout, SwizzleLayout, ComposeLayout, Iter, Axis,
  or layout operations (tile, slice, canonicalize, group, direct_sum, apply, is_tile_inner/outer).

## Source files

- Python API: `python/tvm/tir/layout.py`
- C++ impl: `src/tir/ir/layout/*.cc`
- C++ header: `include/tvm/tir/layout.h`
- Tests: `tests/python/tirx/test_layout.py`
- Usage: `python/tvm/tirx/op_schedule/cuda/copy_async.py`

grep -n "def tile\|def slice\|def apply\|def group\|def direct_sum\|def canonicalize\|def pack\|def unpack" python/tvm/tir/layout.py

# Axis names (thread axes vs memory axes)
